                <h1><b>About this data</b></h1>
                <p>Every week, computer scripts written by reporters at The World-Herald automatically download new campaign finance data from a state website, parse it and load it into this web application.</p>
                
                <p>This is the first time Nebraska campaign finance data has been made available at the transaction level. It means that citizens can start drawing connections between the people and organizations financing state and local elections. It also means XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.</p>
                
                <p>Contributions in federal races are not included here. To explore that data, we recommend <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/" target="_blank">the Center for Responsive Politics' search tool</a>.</p>
